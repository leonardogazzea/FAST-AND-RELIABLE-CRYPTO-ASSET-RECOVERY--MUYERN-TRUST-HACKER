I must confess that the lingering suspicion of betrayal shattered my world. Over time, I noticed subtle changes in my girlfriend’s behavior. She, who had always been open and transparent, became secretive, especially about our finances. Small discrepancies in our shared accounts soon turned into larger concerns. After some investigation, I discovered she had lost over ¥55,000 to scammers, a substantial portion of our life savings in our joint account. My mind raced with questions: How did this happen? Why didn’t she tell me sooner? How could I trust her again?
